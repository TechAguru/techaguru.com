We take a systems approach in building controlled growing environments.

On the commercial size, low capital and operational cost drives of these systems are key to realizing this as a viable way of growing our food.

On the research side, controlled growing environments enable scientists to find varieties fit for various growing conditions.

On the educational side, the controlled environment is a great example of a multi-disciplinary approach to solving problems.
