The promise of IoT for agriculture is to increase quality, increase yield, and minimize resource use with data collected in real-time.

With our frugal innovation approach, we heavily invest in [building sensors](https://blog.techaguru.com/water-level-sensors-for-rice-field-irrigation-ef623fcb8f79) to anticipate a future where small-holder farmers work alongside robots and automated systems to grow fresh food we can all enjoy.

Scaling this technology requires multiple stakeholders to work together.
